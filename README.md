<p align="justify"><b>Abstract</b>: In spite of the growing literature on polarization, relatively little is known about the individual-level patterns underlying the decline of routine jobs and its link with informal employment in a middle-income country context. This paper aims to answer the following questions: what are the employment transitions of routine workers in such context? More particularly, do they face a higher risk of going into informality? And are informal workers in routine jobs also affected by the process of technical change? To shed light on this, we examine the flows of routine workers into and out of formal and informal routine and non-routine occupations over the period 1980-2015 in Chile. Using rich longitudinal data from the Social Protection Survey of Chile, we first reconstruct individuals’ occupational trajectories by classifying individuals into different states at a monthly frequency. We then use a series of multilevel competing risk event history models and a decomposition flow approach to study the flows underlying the decline of routine occupations over time. Our results suggest a process of displacement and occupational downgrading for routine manual workers: workers in routine manual formal employment become increasingly unemployed or use informality as a buffer against job loss, and workers in routine manual informal employment become unemployed or transit to non-routine manual informal occupations. By contrast, workers in routine cognitive occupations seem to be relatively more protected against job displacement and occupational downgrading. Lastly, we find that the decrease in the share of routine jobs in Chile is mostly accounted for by a decrease in the inflow transition rate from unemployment as well as an increase in the outflow transition rates to unemployment and informality.</p>
